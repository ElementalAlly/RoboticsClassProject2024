# Repo for Robotics Class Projects 2024

The projects are all available here. In the Module 3D Models, all the models are available here in STL format. Plug these into the slicing program of your choice, and print it out.

To build the module, outside of the 3d-printed parts you will need are:
- 28BYJ Stepper Motor
- HiLetgo Micro Limit Switch
- 4mm * 10mm * 4mm bearing
